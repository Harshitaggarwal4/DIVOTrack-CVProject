# TrackEval

## Citation
The code is built with [TrackEval](https://github.com/JonathonLuiten/TrackEval). Thanks for their great work.

## Requirements
 Code tested on Python 3.7.
 
 - Minimum requirements: numpy, scipy
 - For plotting: matplotlib
 - For segmentation datasets (KITTI MOTS, MOTS-Challenge, DAVIS, YouTube-VIS): pycocotools
 - For DAVIS dataset: Pillow
 - For J & F metric: opencv_python, scikit_image
 - For simples test-cases for metrics: pytest

use ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` to install all possible requirements.

use ```pip3 install -r minimum_requirements.txt``` to only install the minimum if you don't need the extra functionality as listed above.

## Data preparation
The data is in the following structure:
```
TrackEval/data
    └——————gt
    |        └——————mot_challenge
    |           |——————divo
    |           |        └——————circleRegion_Drone
    |           |        		└——————gt
    |           |        			└——————gt.txt
    |           |        		└——————seqinfo.ini
    |           |        └——————circleRegion_View1
    |           |        		└——————gt
    |           |        			└——————gt.txt
    |           |        		└——————seqinfo.ini
    |		|		...
    |           |——————seqmaps
    |           |        └——————divo.txt
    └——————trackers
    |        └——————mot_challenge
    |           |——————divo
    |           |        └——————"your_result"
    |           |        		└——————data
    |           |        			└——————circleRegion_Drone.txt
    |           |        			└——————circleRegion_View1.txt
    |           |        			└——————circleRegion_View2.txt
    |      	|					    ...
```
Every single line in gt.txt has the format:
```
frame_id,person_id,lx,ly,w,h,1,1,1
```
Remember the tracking result is in "your_result"/data instead of "your_result".
Every single line in "your_result"/data/.txt should has the format:
```
frame_id,person_id,lx,ly,w,h,-1,-1,-1,-1
```


## Evaluation				
```
python scripts/run_mot_challenge.py --GT_FOLDER './data/gt/mot_challenge' --TRACKERS_FOLDER './data/trackers/mot_challenge' --BENCHMARK divo --TRACKERS_TO_EVAL your_result
```
The output will be stored to "./data/trackers/mot_challenge/divo/your_result" and has the following four files: <br>
pedestrian_detailed.csv <br>
pedestrian_plot.png <br>
pedestrian_plot.pdf <br>
pedestrian_summary.txt <br>
